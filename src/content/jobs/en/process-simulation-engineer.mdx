## 2. **Role Overview**

As we scale up our reprecipitation processes, modeling and simulation capabilities are essential to minimize experimental iterations and identify optimal conditions efficiently. In this position, you will develop models for particle nucleation, growth, and aggregation, optimize processes, collect experimental data, explore conditions, and evaluate uncertainties. We seek someone who can seamlessly integrate mathematical modeling with experimental work and embed practical models in our operations.

### What Makes This Role Exciting

- Develop products and technologies driven by real customer demands for commercialization
- Work on simulation tasks directly connected to experimental operations
- Take ownership from model design through implementation to result visualization

---

## 3. Key Responsibilities

- Create models for nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and aggregation processes
- Reproduce particle behavior through computational simulation
- Conduct fundamental CFD analysis considering scale-dependent factors like stirring and mixing
- Integrate experimental data to identify parameters and validate model accuracy
- Implement condition search algorithms and visualization tools
- Collaborate with experimental teams to propose optimal conditions and research directions

## 4. Requirements & Qualifications

### Essential Requirements

- Alignment with NanoFrontier's mission and business vision
- 3+ years of computational science/simulation experience in materials or chemistry, or Master's/PhD degree
- Practical experience in experimental data validation and parameter tuning

### Preferred Qualifications

- Experience with low-level programming languages like C++
- Experience in any of the following areas:
    - Particle behavior modeling (PBM/reaction engineering)
    - Fundamental CFD analysis (stirring, mixing, etc.)
- CAD-based design and simulation experience
- Experience with Bayesian optimization or machine learning for condition search
- Knowledge of colloidal chemistry and dispersion stability

### Ideal Candidate Profile

- Able to execute rapid **hypothesis → model → validation** cycles under uncertain conditions
- Can clearly articulate computational assumptions and limitations while proposing actionable next experiments
- Capable of engaging with experimental teams as equals and solving practical challenges through computation
