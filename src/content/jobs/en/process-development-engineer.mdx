## 3. Key Responsibilities

- Design process flows and equipment layouts, plan necessary equipment and piping, select and coordinate with manufacturers
- Scale-up experiments to adjust experimental conditions to mass production scale and find optimal operating conditions
- Equipment installation, trial operation, verification (FAT/SAT/IQ/OQ) and startup to operation, create work procedures (SOPs)
- Safety and quality management (EHS, SDS, hazardous material response), set quality check items and measurements
- Cost estimation, yield/takt time calculation, bottleneck analysis and improvement proposals
- Record daily work procedures and changes, manage experimental and operation data
