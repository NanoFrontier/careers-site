## 1. About us

NanoFrontier is a deep-tech startup that provides end‑to‑end R&D to mass production for nano‑particle materials. Our core is the reprecipitation (re‑precipitation) method developed over many years at Tohoku University. We develop, manufacture, and assure the quality of materials for energy, environment, and life-science domains. We also offer contract manufacturing and technology licensing, and rapidly drive joint research/PoC with manufacturers and academia from our Sendai base (HQ) and Tokyo hub.
