## 2. Role & Responsibilities

With increasing inquiries and joint research/PoC requests from overseas, we now need a system to advance initial export and contract processes while collaborating with local partners at a practical level simultaneously.

We're looking for someone who understands both chemistry (materials) and customer operations, and can create a sellable state.

### What You'll Gain

- Develop products and technologies that customers need, with commercialization in mind
- Can be the core implementing materials supply × contract manufacturing (CDMO) × technology licensing overseas from 0→1
- Can build sellable mechanisms by crossing regulations, quality, logistics, and contracts from practical operations
- Can translate research/manufacturing/quality/legal seamlessly into forms customers can use

- **Exhibitions & Demos**: Prepare for overseas exhibitions, design demos, operations during exhibitions, post-event follow-up
- **CRM & Knowledge**: Organize cases, estimates, contracts, and SLAs in CRM/Notion, create reusable templates
