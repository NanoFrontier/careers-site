## 1. About us

NanoFrontier is a deep‑tech startup built on the re‑precipitation method developed at Tohoku University. We design, manufacture and assure the quality of nano‑particle materials for energy, environment and life‑science domains. We also provide contract manufacturing and technology licensing, and rapidly drive joint research/PoCs with manufacturers and academia from Sendai (HQ) and Tokyo.

## 2. What you will drive

You will own the 0→1 overseas GTM for our three pillars — materials supply, CDMO, and technology licensing. You will stitch together regulations, quality, logistics and contracts across countries and standardize them into a repeatable, scalable motion.

### Why this role is exciting

- Build products/technologies customers actually need for commercialization
- Design the overseas GTM from scratch across supply × CDMO × licensing
- Create a “ready‑to‑sell” state by orchestrating regulation/quality/logistics/contracts
- Drive co‑creation across academia and manufacturers internationally
- Through our Co‑Creation Lab with Tohoku University, an adjunct position can be arranged for dual careers across academia and industry

## 3. Key responsibilities

- Market development: define ICP per region, account plans, design of expos/demos/joint research
- Deal operations: standardize PoC design (goals/KPIs/org/costs/schedule) → contracts → deployment
- Partner development: source/evaluate/contract/review agents, SIs, joint research and contract manufacturers
- Commercial terms: price lists, quote templates, SLAs, NDA/MSA/licensing baseline terms
- Trade/compliance hub: coordinate Incoterms, export control, SDS/GHS, and country regulations (e.g., REACH/TSCA)
- Cross‑functional: align supply/cost/quality with R&D, Manufacturing, QA/EHS, Legal and FP&A
- Knowledge: maintain overseas playbook (pricing, contracts, regulations, logistics, proposal materials) and training
